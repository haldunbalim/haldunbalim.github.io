I have a profound passion for coding, constantly driven by the allure of novel challenges and opportunities. While my current responsibilities constraints my involvement, I am planning to organize the codebase I crafted during my research into self-contained packages. This initiative aims to enhance their accessibility and applicability. If any of the outlined topics align with your interests, I warmly encourage you to <a href = "mailto: hbalim@ethz.ch"><b>reach out</b></a> and engage in further discussion. Your collaboration and interest would be greatly valued.

<hr style="color: var(--global-text-color); height: 1px; margin-bottom: 2rem;">

A Python toolbox for representing Zonotopes, and applying basic set operations on them. The package is hugely inspired by  <a href="https://www.mpt3.org/">MPT3 Toolbox</a>, and  <a href="https://tumcps.github.io/CORA/">CORA</a>. It is currently under development, and will be released soon.

<hr style="color: var(--global-text-color); height: 1px; margin-bottom: 2rem;">

An efficient and numerically robust Python implementation of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for state-space model identification. The package is based on the paper <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005109805001810"> [1]</a>, and is currently under development. Additionally, I extended the proposed solution to incorporate a-priori known constraints on the system matrices by replacing the closed-form solutions in maximization step by L-BFGS-B based optimization. The resultant algorithm shows promising results both in terms of convergence speed and obtained likelihood. It will be released soon.
