I am currently pursuing a Master of Science degree in Robotics, Systems, and Control at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) where I have the privilege of engaging in collaborative endeavors with remarkable research groups, such as the [AIT Lab](https://ait.ethz.ch), and [IDSC](https://idsc.ethz.ch). My academic journey began with the completion of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering at [Koç University](https://www.ku.edu.tr/en/) in 2021. During the period spanning from September 2022 to February 2023, I had the valuable opportunity to serve as a visiting scholar at [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu), working closely alongside with [Prof. Necmiye Ozay](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~necmiye/), and [Prof. Samet Oymak](https://intra.ece.ucr.edu/~oymak/)


My research interest falls at intersection between **control and machine learning**. My goal is to design **data-driven** and **provably correct** solutions for control of complex dynamical systems. I am particularly interested in **verification of learning-based control algorithms**.
